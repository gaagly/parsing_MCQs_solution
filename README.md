#  This script will parse questions along with their options and answers

# TCS conducts many competitive exams and releases their answer keys along with questions. This scripts parsed those questions and their answers and put them into a CSV file. This CSV file can be used for Styding and Practicing. For eg. In ANKI, these questions can be imported as Flashcards. (that is what I wrote this Script).
# This script Parses questions and answers from HTML file only.
# IT successfully parsed questions from DSSSB PGTANSWER key for EXamination Dated 10.07.2021. However, it was written for the DSSSB PGT TGT exams of 2018.
# So, far it is working very well
